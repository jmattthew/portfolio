PART 1:  INTRODUCTION

*** Are we alone?

Here, within the depths of an infinite void, humankind sits atop the throne of all existence.  The throne of complexity, perception, intelligence, and technology belongs to the inhabitants of an improbable blue biosphere, floating like a speck of dust within the stark vastness of the universe.  Can this really be true?  Or does our species in fact share the infinity of space and the history of time itself with other thinking beings?  Have some distant thinkers pondered the same question that has puzzled humanity since the dawn of science:  Are we alone?  

*** From gods to aliens

Perhaps our greatest discovery as a species has been the scientific method:  the technique of observing and measuring of the world around in order to test our hypotheses about how what it is composed of and how it works.  The scientific revolution has brought us precise knowledge from far beyond our shores, including precisely how large our universe is, how long it has existed, and the dazzling array of celestial bodies it contains.  It taught us that the constellations of the nighttime sky are not deities fixed upon a great spinning dome above the clouds, but instead ancient beams of light produced millions of years ago by colossal orbs of hydrogen burning in deep space.  We now know that trillions of stars exist in the universe that we can see and that the atoms in our bones were created in their furnaces.

Our creation myths have mostly placed earth at the center of the universe surrounded by the gods who watched over us from the skies, but the gods have been unseated from their perch.  The exciting revelations of modern astronomy have displaced the earth from the center of importance in the cosmos while simultaneously deeming the creatures of earth supreme beings of the cosmos.  Yet the evidence of cosmology and evolution allow us to wonder, if the universe could produce one sentient species, could it not produce more than one?  Surely we do not sit alone atop the throne of self-awareness, and perhaps we merely occupy one seat at a table of thousands.  

*** Origin of Fermi's paradox

Maybe we began to wonder about extraterrestrial life because we refuse to accept the awkward and lonely position of being the rulers of all creation.  Perhaps we refuse to accept it because of the very science that informs us just how infinitesimal small we are in the context of trillions of light-years of space and just how brief we have been in the context of billions of years of history.  

Today, many scientists propose that the conditions necessary for the evolution of intelligent life in the universe are abundant.  The theory is so mainstream that SETI, a non-profit research institute dedicated to the idea, raises donations and grants of over 17 million dollars annually.  Even the US government, via NASA, funded the search for extraterrestrial intelligence for decades, with Carl Segan as one of the program's most famous advocates.  

But those who believe that alien life is probable are faced with a paradox that was popularized in 1950 by the eponymous physicist cum philosopher, Enrico Fermi.  Fermi's Paradox famously conjectures:  if our observable universe contains trillions of billions of stars, many of which have existed for billions of years longer our own sun, and many of which contain planets both welcoming to life and seeded with the same organic chemicals as are found on earth, then why have we yet to find any evidence that and extraterrestrials exist or indeed have ever existed?  In short, to quote Fermi, "Where are they?"

Many theories have been proposed, some of which - as we will discuss - uproot the very premise that life should be abundant.  The paradox has been discussed for the past 60 years, but this series will provide you with a new framework to understand the riddle and determine your own answers.  

*** The questions

If tomorrow's newspaper headlines announced the discovery of an extraterrestrial transmission, it would be an event billions of years in the making.  It requires that another intelligence was born after their own parallel history of evolution from simpler organisms.  It would mean that they survived as an intelligent species for long enough to seek us out or for their transmissions to reach us.  Next, they would need to have been born close enough to our sun and/or have searched hard enough to find us amongst the billions of other suns in the universe.  After discovering or unintentionally transmitting a message to us, our two species would need to be similar enough to communicate at all.  Finally, unless we discovered their transmissions by accident, they would need to want us to know that they exist.  It should also be mentioned, for the benefit of those who wear a tin-foil hat, that newspaper headlines would mean that the answer to Fermi's Paradox has not been suppressed by our leaders.  

*** Structure of lecture

We'll use this sequence of events, from the potential birth of alien technology to our learning about it, as the framework on our journey to answer Fermi's question.  We'll dissect the riddle in a series of simple yes-or-no questions.  Each answer of "yes" leads to more intriguing possibility.  Meanwhile, an answer of "no" at any point in the series means that humankind will never encounter a message from another world.  Throughout this journey, you will hear arguments mostly from the "negative" point of view.  For each question, you'll hear several reasons suggesting that the answer is "no" based on logic or scientific theory.  Yet the possibility that each can be answered with "yes" remains.  The paradox has not been solved, and you must decide for yourself whether or not you agree with what you hear.




*** What will not be considered

We'll consider many possibilities using only the mainstream suppositions of the scientific search for extraterrestrials.  This means that we won't consider more esoteric theories such as possible separate universes, alternate dimensions, or of existence prior to the big-bang.  Nor will we consider the possibility of super-luminal travel via wormholes, space warping devices, or supernatural explanations.  We'll assume that we and our potential alien cousins are all bound to the three physical dimensions, time, and the speed limit of light.  Though this journey is informed by scientific fact, beware that we are now embarking into the arena of philosophy.  There can be no truly scientific answers to any of the questions that follow.  If you find yourself holding a conviction about any of those answers, that reveals little about the true nature of the universe, but perhaps something valuable about yourself.





PART 2:  Where they ever born?

*** Intelligence star

Our solar system radiates a very specific and rare energy signature.  Quite literally, it shines intelligence.  For the creatures in its orbit have learned to collect its solar energy then radiate it back out into the universe, broadcasting their ascendancy to technology.  Our sun is an intelligence star, and for the past 200 years, it shined with the message that intelligence has arrived to the galaxy.  Our sun may be the only one of its kind that has ever existed, however, we've learned some astounding facts about our universe that challenge the notion that humankind are the sole inheritors of intelligence.  

The very first question we must ask regarding possible contact with extraterrestrial technology is:  Were they ever born?  But before we begin our speculation, we must consider what science tells us about the enormity of space and time and the potential for evolution beyond our atmosphere.  

*** Size of the universe

Though often described as infinite, the size of the entire universe is unknown may be unknowable.  The big-bang distributed matter evenly throughout the entire universe, and stars that have since formed on opposite ends of the void are so far apart that no information or energy can from one can ever reach the other even if given an infinite amount of time.  This strange fact is due to two constants that make up the bedrock of our understanding of physics and astronomy and that are constants throughout every region of space.  The first is the unbreakable speed limit of light and the second is that fact that the fabric of space itself is expanding and has been expanding since the birth of time.

*** Our observable universe

As all of space every expands apart from itself, the most distant regions are spreading apart faster than than any particle within that space can keep up with.  A photon at a sufficient distance from earth, racing towards us at light-speed, as fast as anything in the universe can possible travel, still cannot keep pace with the ever expanding distance it would need to cross in order to reach us. 

These facts create a permanent bubble around the earth of maximum observability, and we can never know what lies beyond it.  The size of the universe that can we can ever observe is a magnificent 94 billion light-years across, yet some scientists predict that the entire universe is larger than our observable universe by a factor of 10 to the 23rd power.  If this is correct, if the odds are than at intelligence star emerges just within a given 94 billion light-years span of space, then the entire universe is teaming with a billion-trillion intelligence species.  Yet, the laws of physics stipulate that every single one of them will be forever invisible to the others.

*** The number of stars

However, this hardly rules out the possibility of alien contact.  The number of stars within our bubble is still inconceivably large, and the odds of one of those stars evolving technology may be significant.  Scientists estimate that our observable universe contains a total volume of 400 trillion cubic light-years 17 trillion-billion stars.  That is a greater number of stars, as Carl Segan so lyrically expressed, "than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the planet Earth."  

*** the size of the odds

Even with infinitesimal odds, such gigantic numbers make it more probable that at least two stars have evolved an intelligent species.  What does it mean for us to be one in 17 trillion-billion?  Imagine buying a single ticket to the California state lottery and winning the Mega Millions drawing, then buying a second ticket and winning Mega Million again.  The odds that the observable universe contains only one intelligence star are a million times less likely than that.  With only one example, we have no way to determine the actual odds.  But we do know that the cosmos has had a very, very long time to roll the dice.  Science has revealed evidence leading many to suspect that life as we know it may be abundant throughout the cosmos and that evolution could be an emergent property of the universe.  

*** Liquid water

As our instruments have become so refined, and our gaze more penetrating, we have discovered that many of the stars around us are orbited by planets of their own.  We learned that many of these are highly similar to earth in size, composition, and distance from their sun.  These planets are at the ideal distance from their own suns to maintain an atmosphere and liquid water at their surface.  Additionally, we know of many planets and moons that are quite unlike Earth yet can sustain life as we know it.  

** tidal heating

Liquid water is substrate of all organic life.  A body orbiting too close to its parent star will cause any water to evaporate into space.  Orbiting too far away causes it to freeze.  However, even with our solar system, liquid water can exist far from the sun.  Some of the icey moons of the distantly orbiting planets know as the gas giants maintain the temperature needed for liquid water through tidal heating.  As the moon's distance from its host varies over the course of its orbit, the ice on its surface is squeezed and stretched by gravity, creating a friction the heats the ice and turns it to liquid.  

*** Steppenwolf planets

Stranger still is the possibility of water on "rogue planets", which have been ejected from their solar system, set adrift through interstellar space far from the light of any sun.  These dark worlds are coated with a thick layer of ice, yet liquid oceans are maintained by the heat from their planet's core.  Any creatures evolving on these so-called "Steppenwolf planets" might be similar to the those found near the deep ocean hydrothermal vents on earth.  They would have no concept of light and darkness, only heat and cold.

*** comets

Water did not originate on Earth.  Every sea that humankind has ever sailed, every river and tributary, and indeed the very blood within our veins is composed of water that once rode across the universe like an icy chariot.  The water of comets filled our primordial oceans, and they also may have delivered the first primitive organic compounds to our once lifeless rock.  Even the constituent organic chemicals and precursors of life of earth did not originate here.  As the tendrils of humanity have reached our planetary neighbor, Mars, our probes have discovered in its red dust the presence those same organic compounds, perhaps of extrasolar origin.

Just as comets brought the possibility of life to our solar system, they have undoubtedly performed the same service for billions of other distant stars.  We can be certain that Earth is not the only fertile soil to have inherited the seeds of evolution.  If the tree of life has taken root on even the tiniest fraction of the nearly innumerable stars that surround us, and if this tree inevitably bears the fruits of intelligence and technology, then we are merely one amongst a great orchard.  Time itself is so ancient that the first technological species may have strolled through the galactic orchard hundreds of millions of years before the first single-celled organisms arose on earth.  It's possible that our nearest stargazing neighbors once resided right here in the Milky Way, for our sun is by far one of the youngest amongst its siblings in the galaxy.

*** No because God

It's possible that they were born.  But for many, the answer of "no" to this is question is as simple as the faith that after 6 days, God made man, then he rested.  Those who aren't fundamentalist Christians may find that answer unsatisfactory, but before you dismiss it out of hand or in the name of science, consider that fact that we have no evidence whatsoever that life has evolved anywhere but on earth, let alone intelligent life.  The theory that a star may evolve intelligence given the right conditions and enough time is certainly reasonable, and it is supported by circumstantial evidence.  However, at least at the moment, the theory is unfalsifiable.  Even stating a probability is impossible by the rigid definitions of science.  

*** No because improbable

That said, the evidence of a God who didn't make aliens is even smaller than the evidence that aliens exist.  While science must maintain the position that we simply have no evidence one way or the other, philosophers can speculate based on the scientific evidence of the history of life on Earth.  A more logical objection to the possibility of extraterrestrials is that human evolution couldn't have occurred if not for a series of several highly improbable natural events.  Taken together, these events may indeed be less likely than one in 140 quintillion.  

*** RNA

Though many distant stars may harbor watery planets capable of primitive life, the spontaneous emergence of RNA is far less likely.  RNA is a cellular molecule that, like the more familiar DNA molecule, is able to store genetic information and catalyze the creation of proteins.  All current life on earth requires simultaneously requires DNA and proteins.  Proteins are the building blocks of all cells, including DNA itself.  Meanwhile, DNA contains the blueprint needed to build each protein.  This cycle creates a chicken-and-egg problem.  RNA is used by cells to copy portions of the DNA blueprint that are used to create proteins, and is the likely precursor to the evolution of DNA.  

But how did RNA emerge from simple organic compounds?  Though our planet formed a billion years before the emergence of the first cells, some scientists don't believe that was enough time for RNA to evolve.  Additionally, from what we know of earth's primordial seas, they didn't provide the necessary chemical conditions.  Our best explanation may be a hypothesis known as panspermia, in which RNA was delivered to Earth on the backs of asteroids.  The scenario would mean that RNA first emerged on other worlds that had more hospitable conditions for it than earth.  It also allows for many billions of years for the spontaneous emergence of RNA rather than just one.

*** moon and asteroids

The obstacles to our evolution only begin with with RNA.  All current life on Earth also owes its existence to the shelter of our moon, which protected Earth from asteroids collisions and stabilized its orbit.  Too many impacts could easily have wiped Earth's slate clean of all lifeforms.  But strangely, too few events could have prevented our evolution as well.  Despite the moon's protection, 99% of all species that once lived on Earth are now extinct due to several mass extinction events.  The events in earth's long history were seemingly perfectly timed to create greater diversity by killing off dominant species.  For example, large mammals including humans could not have evolved until the dinosaurs were wiped out.  

*** technology not guaranteed

The search for an intelligence star depends on more than the evolution of complex lifeforms, and more even the the evolution of creatures with intelligence and self-awareness.  Apes and chimps have both qualities but lack the next critical step of evolution, the development of technology.  As evidenced by the simians, intelligence doesn't guarantee language use, arguably humanity's first technology, and certainly doesn't guarantee microchips.  Technology is important because it's impossible to discover an alien species until it creates some identifiable signature such as significantly modifying its home world, launching probes beyond its solar system, or at least broadcasting radio waves to the stars.  

*** humanity's youth

By that logic, we ourselves are only very recently discoverable.  We are very young in the context of the earth's 4.6 billion years of earth's existence.  If that timeline was compressed into a single day, then Homo sapiens has existed for only the past 9 seconds of that day.  Furthermore, if existence of of Homo sapiens were compressed into a single day, then we've only been discoverable for the past 35 seconds of that day.

** no because we're the first

Considering the youth of our species and our technology, it might be much more likely that we are discovered first by a much older alien species than that we would find them.  However, it's also possible that we are alone in the universe simple because we're the first to arrive.  Surprisingly, this possibility that the emergence of evolution and technology is highly probable throughout the universe.  We could be the first if the universe has only recently become hospitable towards life, as some scientist theorize.  

*** generations of stars

The sun is a member of the third and youngest generation of stars known as a Population-I star.  The oldest generation of stars, called Population-III were born not long after the big-bang, and contained only hydrogen and helium atoms.  They were made of the two lightest elements because almost none of the other elements in the periodic table existed yet.  This extinct race of stars existed during the dark-ages when the entire universe was an opaque fog of sub-atomic particles.  They actually burned in darkness.  Like newer stars, the fusion reaction within them did produce light, but these photons instantly collided with other particles.      

Eventually the most ancient stars exploded into supernovas, clearing the fog of sub-atomic particles and leading to the creation of second generation stars.  Most of the heavier elements in the universe were created by these Population-II stars, including those essential to life, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.  The heavier elements were forged within the first bright suns, whose energy is released in the process of fusing the lighter atoms together to create heavier ones.  

It's likely that life had to wait until the formation of third generation of stars because these were the first to support planetary systems.  Rocky planets such as Earth are composed of heavier elements, and even gaseous planets require a rocky core for the gas to accrete around.  Life as we know it could not begin until the formation of planets with liquid water.

*** gamma ray bursts

Another possibility for why all complex life in the universe may only have evolved recently is if all early life was destroyed by bursts of gamma rays.  Strange intergalactic death rays are known to exist and thought to be released by exploding hypernovas.  These explosions release a narrow jet of high-energy particles for just a few seconds, but it contains as much energy as our sun will release during its 11 billion year lifespan.  Even now, a burst originating as far away as the Crab Nebula would obliterate all life on Earth if we happened to lie directly in its path.  Fortunately for us, these events appear to be very rare and found mostly in older galaxies and at galaxy centers.  Lifeforms orbiting older suns may not have been so lucky.  It's possible that gamma ray bursts were once much more frequent, and that older planets across the universe were repeatedly sterilized before life could gain a foothold.

*** not enough time

Mankind may also be the first born son of the universe if the theory of panspermia is correct.  This would mean that RNA did not originate on earth but instead arrived here after several billion of years of evolution on another planet.  In that case, the time needed for the evolution of intelligence anywhere in the universe might be nine billion years, or double Earth's age.  Meanwhile, the oldest third generation stars, those with orbiting planets, were born 10 billion years ago.  In this hypothetical scenario, the oldest potential intelligence would have a billion year head start on humanity.  However, we could be the first due to a combination of factors such as earlier extraterrestrial life having been destroyed by gamma rays or the evolution from amoebas to rocket-builders simply taking more time on other planets.

Were they ever born?  Is the universe tend to give rise to life just as it tends to give rise to stars?  Or was life less than a one in quintillion chance and humanity a lucky accident?  If another intelligent species has had both the time and the appropriate conditions to evolve from their star, then it's still possible that we will meet some sunny day.  But for that to happen, being born isn't enough.  They will also have to have survived.





PART 3:  Did they survive?

Whether morbid or prudent, modern culture is obsessed with its own apocalypse.  Only the four generations of the human species has had to come to grips with the fact we are fully capable erasing X million years of intelligent procreation as well as any trace that we ever existed on this planet.  Around the same

DID THEY FIND US?

*** Sphere of communication

Even if many exist within the sphere of our observable universe, our own sun's relative adolescence significantly narrows the number that we can hope to make contact with.  If we assume that we are a typical example, then 4.6 billion is the number of years required for any star to evolve a technological species capable of broadcasting the calling-card of their intelligence out to the stars.  Now, taking the known age of the universe minus the theoretical length of time required for evolution, we can derive that the oldest probable technological species was born 9.2 billion years ago.  Furthermore, if that species sent a message towards earth 9.2 billion years ago, then due to the speed limit of light, it cannot have traveled any further than 9.2 billion light-years distance.  

This means that while the distance to the edge of the observable universe is 47 billion light-years, the edge of the sphere of probable alien communication is less than a tenth of that distance.  Any star within this secondary sphere has theoretically had time enough both to evolve the capability to send us a message and for the message to have traveled across the eons to reach us today.  While a much smaller sphere than that of the observable universe, it still contains a volume of 3.3 trillion cubic light-years of space and roughly 140 quintillion stars.  

	stars:
	1.4 * 10^20

	light-bulbs:
	3,375 per m^3
	3.4e9 per km^2*m

	earth surface area:
	5.1e8 km²
	5.1e14 m² * 80m tall * 3375 = 1.4e20 lightbulbs

If we are alone within our communication sphere, then it means that the probability of stars evolving a technological life-form is minute indeed.  

*** Visualizing the odds

To comprehend the extraordinarily vast number of stars within that sphere, imagine if each of these stars were each the size of an ordinary light-bulb, about 60 millimeters in diameter.  If you ordered a shipment of such light-bulbs in the same quantity as this number of stars, then you would also need a very large storehouse in which to store them.  Packing them side-by-side as densely as possible, your storehouse would need to be 80 meters tall, about 20 floors, and it would need to cover the entire surface of the earth, both land and water.  If you can imagine this planet-encircling, 20-story high building filled to its brim with light-bulbs, then you have a sense of the maximum number of suns that could possibly send us us a message.  If we are alone amongst our stars, it means that the probability of the emergence of intelligent life is less than one in 140 billion billion.
