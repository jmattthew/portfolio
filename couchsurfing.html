		<h1>CouchSurfing.com Case Study</h1>

	</div>
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>
		CouchSurfing.com was one of the pioneer website of what came to be know as the “sharing economy”.  It preceded both AirBnb and Lyft, and many of the tools for trust ratings were incubated by CouchSurfing, then duplicated and improved by other successful websites.  
	</p>
	<p>
		I joined CouchSurfing three years after its public launch in 2004 as the 2nd full-time employee.  I helped select and hire almost every employee who followed me, growing the company to 45 people, and building the product department from the ground up.  I co-designed the first CouchSurfing mobile app, my product initiatives helped the company acquire $21 million in venture capital funding.
	</p>
	<p>
		For five years I tackled many and diverse product challenges, and I had a hand in the full product stack.  My responsibilities included business strategy, product management, product design, and UX.
	</p>

	</a>
	<p>
		In collaboration with my talented team members, I product managed and launched CouchSurfing's first iOS mobile app, I created the product design and UX for the <a href="#experiences" class="pageLink"><span>casual meetups</span></a> tool.  I overhauled the interfaces for user <a href="#profiles" class="pageLink"><span>profile search</span></a> and <a href="#messaging" class="pageLink"><span>user messaging</span></a>, and I oversaw our first rebranding effort.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Through ongoing quantitative analysis, I optimized the revenue funnel, revamped the first-time user experience, created new strategies for our user <a href="#matching" class="pageLink"><span>matching algorithm</span></a>, and designed internal tools for user safety and customer support.  I also had a hand in the UI of many smaller features such as the <a href="#hosting" class="pageLink"><span>hosting availability</span></a> widget.  
	</p>
	<h2>Examples</h2>
	<a name="profiles"></a>
	<h3>User Profiles</h3>
	<p>
		We redesigned results list when searching for people to meet based on interviews with users, quantitative research, and eye-tracking.  The PDF below explains the before and after in greater detail.

	</a>
	<a name="hosting"></a>
	<h3>Hosting Availability</h3>
	<p>
		The PDF below shows several UX design options for a widgets to be used by CouchSurfing members to mark their avialbility to host other members.

	<h3>Matching &amp; Messaging</h3>
	<p>
		CouchSurfing is a dual sided "marketplace", with times of inequal supply and demand in different parts of the world and in different seasons.  I proposed multiple solutions to improve our matching algorithm taking into account these market dynamics and user behavior.  I also proposed improvements to the matching algorithm to better ensure that members had a great experience meeting each other based on user ratings.

	<a name="experiences"></a>
	<h3>Casual Meetups</h3>
	<p>
		The "couch" was just one of the potential venues for an experience between to members.  Initially, the only other venue was organized events.  I helped create the third venue, our casual meetups product, which allowed members to spontaneously gather around a place of interest or an activity.  The PDF below shows some early prototype UX for this product and a flow chart explaining how members choose the right venue to meet their needs.
