	<h2>Native Mobile &amp; Web</h2>
	<p>
		Continue reading below for a case study of the native mobile app, or learn about the <a href="cardpool_web.html" target="_self"><span>responsive website</span></a>.
	</p>
	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>
		As the sole UX designer for Cardpool, my challenge was to launch our first mobile app, moving from sketchpad to app store in 7 months.  The project clock was already ticking by the time I was hired, so I was expected to air drop in at full sprint.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cardpool is an online exchange for pre-owned gift cards.  While visitors can both buy discounted gift cards and sell unwanted cards, the product mission for the app was to increase sales.  Our ancillary goal was to expand the user base to a wider audience by modernizing the user interface and visual design.  You can view the final product by installing the <a href="cardpool/appstore.html" target="_blank"><span>Cardpool iPhone App</span></a>.
	</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Launched the app in 7 months.</li>
		<li>Exceeded 1 million in revenue 4 months after launch.</li>
		<li>Acheived visit-to-sale conversion that surpasses the industry average.</li>
		<li>Earned 4.5 star rating in the App Store (summer 2017 version).</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Process</h2>
	<p>
		Right away I began conducting research, beginning with thorough <a href="#analysis" class="pageLink"><span>competitive analysis</span></a>.  Combining this research with our product goals, I began architecting the <a href="#analysis" class="pageLink"><span>app flow</span></a>.  Once UX designs were ready, I conducted in-person <a href="#usabilityTesting" class="pageLink"><span>usability testing</span></a> to discover pain points.  I studied our marketing research to create <a href="#personas" class="pageLink"><span>personas</span></a> for visual design and prepared several <a href="#prototypes" class="pageLink"><span>prototypes</span></a> of the animated interactions.  Finally, I delivered an end-to-end functional prototype to engineering as they began their first sprints.
	</p>
	<a name="analysis"></a>
	<h3>Competitive research</h3>
	<p>
		Cardpool’s top competitor was first to market with their mobile app, which meant we were playing catch up.  I dissected their app’s user flow to find good ideas we could duplicate and to surface their usability flaws.  Their app-map and navigation was intuitive but they lacked a visually dynamic presentation of their brands.  I looked to other top online retailers for presentation ideas including lifestyle imagery and scrolling animation.  Our top competitor had a strong checkout flow but lacked the strong security features that our product team required.  I looked at banking and online wallet apps for ideas to guide users through the necessary security hurdles.

	<h3>Usability testing</h3>

	<p>
		I had modeled the entire mobile app as a fully interactive prototype with real brands that could be used for precise usability testing.  We hired a testing firm to provide facilities and recruit 10 users for 90 minute interview sessions.  I identified the most important open-ended tasks to give each user, and I observed the interviews on-site to.  We conducted interviews by day, and by night I iterated the prototype based on the days feedback.
	</p>
	<p>
		We discovered an important oversight where we had included out-of-stock brands in our sort by top-discount, which led to user frustration.  We also learned how to clarify our security hurdles with a better progress-meter and by making our forms more visually exciting.  We learned many smaller but crucial lessons about the visual design, including improving readability with higher color-contrast and more visible error messages.
	</p>

	<h3>Visual Design Personas</h3>
	<p>
		To meet our tight deadline, we decided to outsource visual design to an agency, and I provided art direction.  Marketing demographic survey research revealed that 50% of the legacy user base was 45 and older.  The business need was for the visual design to appeal to a younger and more diverse user base.  I developed marketing personas to guide the visual design.

	<h3>Prototyping &amp; Design</h3>

	<p>
		To quickly scale our engineering talent pool we hired a team of temporary contract iOS developers.  Given the number of external staff, I wanted to provide the team with a fully functional prototype that modeled every button on every screen within the app.
	</p>
	<p>
		Development began as soon as the first screen had a wireframe and design mockup, and I managed to stay just ahead of the development team over the next seven months.  Meanwhile, I provided art direction to the design agency and coordinated our contract copy editor.
	</p>
	<h2>Post-launch</h2>
	<p>
		I continued to recommend app updates based on the study of our analytics and direct user feedback.  I also applied the learnings from the mobile app project to begin designing Cardpool's <a href="cardpool_web.html" target="_self"><span>responsive website</span></a>.
